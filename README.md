[00:00.68] I swear, they wanna see me fall
[00:02.53] Writin' verses in my classes, blastin' music through the hall
[00:06.10] And don't say I need assistance, 'cause I don't need that at all
[00:09.37] Put my whole arm in the rim because you know I'm born to ball
[00:13.81] And the critics, they can talk, but I won't listen
[00:16.79] On my own, rode in this shit, bitch, on a mission
[00:20.24] Still with my family and my brothers, my division
[00:22.92] Told 'em,"Calm down," he don't want no static, want no friction
[00:26.85] Slide then, we know you not fightin' (we know you not)
[00:29.46] We keep them blades on us like Attack on Titan (okay, okay)
[00:32.90] Okay, come slide then, we know that you hidin' (bitch)
[00:36.22] Try to run up on us, hope you know that, boy, you dyin'

[00:41.05] My niggas whippin' them Jags
[00:42.62] She said that she wanted a gift
[00:43.67] So I walked in the store and bought her a Louis bag
[00:46.00] And these niggas wanna be me so bad
[00:47.57] And I know that shit been fact
[00:49.66] 'Cause they in my phone sayin', "Oh my God, I wish I had that"
[00:52.93] I'm sufferin' in my silence, get out my phone, wildin'
[00:56.13] Walkin' on 'em, stylin', flyin' over islands
[00:59.45] Made my dreams reality, but these niggas can't do the same
[01:02.68] Uh, my niggas gon' bring fatalities if you keep bringin' up my name
[01:06.01] And I mean that shit on God
[01:07.72] I ain't stoppin', no, I don't wan' pause
[01:09.44] I'm finna get all that attention, baby
[01:11.33] Finna get all that applause
[01:12.93] Don't care if I fit in at all
[01:14.65] Not stoppin', no, I won't stall
[01:16.41] And I'm not pickin' up my calls
[01:17.91] On the court, bitch, I'm gon' ball
